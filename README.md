This synthetic dataset is designed to approximate the structure and statistical properties of the HAALSI dataset. Its primary purpose is to provide a controlled setting for understanding and interpreting the results of the bootstrapped clustering pipeline, as well as for evaluating the impact of different preprocessing choices on clustering outcomes by provided a previously known “ground truth”.
